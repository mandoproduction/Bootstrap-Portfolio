                                He was born May 17, 1973 to Delores and Almando Dwyer. In 1988 at age 15, he migrated to the United States. He lived in various sections of Philadelphia before moving to Delaware County where he now resides. In the old days at Olney High, his nickname was "Church Boy" because of his love for singing church songs. Craig's love for this music was fostered at numerous churches that he attended as a child. He is currently attending Freedom Fellowship Church in the Overbrook section of Philadelphia. As his love for this music grew, he desired to create his own, so he organized "MandoProduction." His hope was/and is to introduce the world to a new and creative way of viewing the art of music; one that can be embraced by other music lovers. Some of his musical influences in addition to the traditional gospel music of his youth are: "The Five Blind Boys from Alabama," "Shirley Caesar," "Milton Jones," "The Commission," "Take Six," "Fred Hammond," "Hezekiah Walker," "John Pee Kee," "Tyrone Tribet," "Mary Mary," "Yolanda Adams," "Smokey Norfolk," and "Tremaine Hawkins," etc.
